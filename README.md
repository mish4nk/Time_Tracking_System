# TIME TRACKING & PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

• Many organizations still rely on manual or semi-automated methods to track employee work hours, which leads to inefficiencies and inaccurate productivity analysis.  
The absence of a centralized digital time tracking system results in several issues:

1. **Inaccurate Time Records:**  
   Manual tracking can lead to errors, missing logs, and incorrect work-hour calculations.

2. **Time-Consuming Processes:**  
   Employees and administrators spend unnecessary time recording, verifying, and managing work hours.

3. **Lack of Productivity Insights:**  
   Without proper analysis and reports, it becomes difficult to identify productivity trends and performance gaps.

4. **Limited Transparency and Control:**  
   Manual systems lack real-time visibility, reporting, and policy enforcement for work hours and breaks.
